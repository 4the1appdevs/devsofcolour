# How to build locally
to build locally:
* first make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org) installed (this has been tested with node version v10.15.3 and npm version 6.4.1)
* While in the `devsofcolour` directory in your terminal of choice, run `npm install` to install the repos packaged dependencies
* once that's complete, run `npm start`
* your terminal prompt should provide you with a few different local addresses to access both the live build of the website as well as the CMS interface for managing content
* If you run into any issues or have concerns please use the [issues tab](https://github.com/tatianamac/devsofcolour/issues) on the github repo.
